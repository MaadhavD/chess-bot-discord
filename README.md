# this is a Discord bot that allows users to play chess in a Discord server. The chess module is used to create a chess board, manipulate it, and generate images of it. The discord and commands modules are used to interact with the Discord API and create commands for the bot to respond to.
# you have to use python-chess== 0.25.1.
The ChessWidget class sets up a graphical user interface (GUI) using Tkinter, which allows users to interact with the chess board using drag and drop. The update_board method updates the positions of the pieces on the board, using the place method from Tkinter to specify the positions of the individual pieces. 
The on_drag_start, on_drag_move, and on_drag_release methods handle the drag and drop functionality, allowing users to move pieces on the board by clicking and dragging them.

The bot has several commands that can be used in a Discord server:

!newgame starts a new game of chess, resetting the board to its initial state.
!move allows a user to make a move on the board by specifying the source and destination squares.
!showboard sends an image of the current state of the board to the Discord channel.
!getmove uses the stockfish chess engine to calculate the best move for the current position and makes the move on the board.
The on_command_error function handles errors that may occur while processing a command, such as if a user tries to use a command they don't have permission to use or if they input an invalid command.
